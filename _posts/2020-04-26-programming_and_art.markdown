> *"Beauty will save the world"* - **Fyodor Dostoevsky**

☆ My name is Erin Mettille. Born in Maryland, raised in the countryside of Pennsylvania ("Pursue your happiness!") I was lucky enough to have a fairly idyllic childhood and spent a majority of my time reading, drawing pictures, and making little fairy houses out of mud and twigs.

☆ As a creative individual, I want to learn a skill that will allow me to help others in a way that is practical and inspiring. I have always been an A R T I S T (fancy!). Bringing beauty and joy to the lives of other through creation is my mission. I have found that there are a multitude of avenues to accomplish this. I've made pet portraits, painted large scale murals, refurbished furniture, organized homes, designed interiors, illustrated a mobile game, sewn clothing, and established branding for businesses.

☆ It may seem that as a visual problem solver that I should trod the path of UI/UX design - but I feel that field is inundated and I want to build things that are practical from the ground up. I've witnessed several small business owners struggle with integrating technology with their work because they have to use a hodgepodge of software to meet their needs... I want to create simple, elegant solutions instead of seeing websites and programs that don't fulfill the purpose they claim to be designed for.

☆ These are troubling times (thanks Covid19), but I would like to take this opportunity to educate myself in a way that will allow me to launch a career in the tech industry while also giving me the chance to build tools to benefit people. Everyday people.

> **Faced with the sacredness of life and of the human person, and before the marvels of the universe, wonder is the only appropriate attitude."**
